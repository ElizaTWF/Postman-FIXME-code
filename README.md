#Postman FIXME code


"These are some old tests, we've had hanging around for a while. We would like you to debug them for us"
Import / copy the tests into POSTMAN. 
Start a GET request against any of the endpoints listed at the top of the file for the Swagger Petstore (Does not matter which one)
Run the tests => most will fail
Ask the tester to debug the tests and get them passing
