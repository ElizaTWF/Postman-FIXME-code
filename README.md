#Postman FIXME code


"These are some old tests, we've had hanging around for a while. We would like you to debug them for us"

Import / copy the tests into POSTMAN. <br>
Start a GET request against any of the endpoints listed at the top of the file for the Swagger Petstore (Does not matter which one)  <br>
Run the tests => most will fail  <br>
Ask the tester to debug the tests and get them passing
